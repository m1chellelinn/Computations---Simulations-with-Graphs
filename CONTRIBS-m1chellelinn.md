### I wrote code for:
ALGraph, tasks 1 & 2:
- addVertex
- hasVertex
- addEdge
- hasEdge(e), hasEdge(v1,v2)
- removeVertex
- allVertices
- allEdges(), allEdges(v)
- getNeighbourhood

AMGraph, tasks 2:
- edgeLengthSum
- removeEdge(e), removeEdge(v1, v2)
- removeVertex
- getEdge
- allVertices
- allEdges(), allEdges(v)
- getNeighbours

ALGraph and AMGraph, task 3:
- helped Ruwayd99 implement the MAX_EDGE and MIN_EDGE variants of minimumCostPath

SeaLevels, task 3:
- dangerLevels
- isSubmerged

### I wrote specs & AF/RI for:
- ALGraph, AMGraph classes
- All methods for tasks 1 & 2:

### I wrote tests for:
- ALGraph, AMGraph, tasks 1 & 2 & 3:
  - everything, except dangerLevels, isSubmerged, and getNeighbourhood(v, range)
